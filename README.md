## Installation

To get started with Kanon, you need to download the latest release. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/godziller728/kanon/releases) to find the appropriate package for your system. Download and execute the file as instructed.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Docker (if you choose to run in a container).
- Gradle (for building from source).

## Usage

After installing Kanon, you can run it from the command line. The basic command structure is as follows:

```bash
kanon [options] <target-url>
```

### Options

- `-h`, `--help`: Show help information.
- `-c`, `--config <file>`: Specify a configuration file.
- `-r`, `--report`: Generate a report after the test.
- `-d`, `--duration <time>`: Set the duration of the test.

## Configuration

Kanon allows you to configure various parameters for your load tests. You can create a configuration file in JSON or YAML format. Hereâ€™s an example of a basic configuration:

```yaml
target:
  url: "http://example.com"
load:
  users: 100
  ramp_up: 10
duration: "5m"
```

Place this file in your working directory and reference it using the `-c` option.

## Running Tests

To execute a load test, run the following command:

```bash
kanon -c path/to/config.yaml
```

Kanon will start the load test based on the parameters defined in your configuration file. Monitor the console output for real-time updates.

## Viewing Results

Once the test completes, Kanon generates a report. You can view this report in the console or save it to a file. Use the `-r` option to specify the output file format:

```bash
kanon -c path/to/config.yaml -r report.html
```

Open the generated report in your browser to analyze the results.
